Moderator Tasks
===============

The major task for moderators: maintain [map-data.js], delete/correct obsolete items and add new items,
fix broken links.

A syntactical mistake with commas, quotes or brackets does not just affect the changed item but renders the map empty.
So prepare your changes with a local copy or public fork.
In case of [panic] you can revert a pull request.
