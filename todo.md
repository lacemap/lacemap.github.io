===========================================

One pin that was not moved into the map:

* [www](https://www.egausa.org/index.php/) **00149 Point de Gaze Handkerchief - The Embroiderers' Guild of America permanent collection**,   There is lace in this collection,  however you have to be a member of the guild to fully scope it out.
