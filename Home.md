If your want to contribute with a translation but don't have a website that allows you to publish it:

* [fork] the project
* remove the files `map-config.js` and `map-data.js` (follow their links on the home page of your fork and select the garbage bin)
* complete the last two URLs in `index.html`
<pre>
  `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/master/map-data.js"></script>`
  `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/master/map-config.js"></script>`
</pre>
* check the result on `https://github.io/YOUR-ACCOUNT/lacemap.github.io/`
* edit the `index.html`, `README.md` and wiki pages in your own fork to replace the English text with your own wording in your own language. Oh, and don't forget to translate the project description just below the tabs on the home page of your fork.
