If your want to contribute with a translation but don't have a website to publish it (as explained on the [readme]):

* [fork] the project
* remove the files `map-config.js` and `map-data.js` (follow their [links](https://github.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io) and select the garbage bin)
* complete the last two URLs in `index.html`
<pre>
  `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/master/map-data.js"></script>`
  `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/master/map-config.js"></script>`
</pre>
* check the result on `https://github.io/YOUR-ACCOUNT/lacemap.github.io/`
* edit the `index.html`, `README.md` and wiki pages to replace the English text with your own wording in your own language. Oh, and don't forget to translate the project description just below the tabs on the home page of your fork.
